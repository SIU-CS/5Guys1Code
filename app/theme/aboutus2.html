								<p style="color:black" align="center"> The basis of the project is a simple organization application that the user can input appointments, meetings, <br> class assignments, and tests to get a simple calendar that will organize the upcoming work based on amount of <br>time to prepare (or complete) and a priority level set by the user. 
														This is the most creative part of the application <br> in which we can create a system to prioritize and manage the user’s weekly load to help them with their organization <br> and remind them when they need to be studying or doing coursework that may have slipped their mind. The <br> target audience for this application is college students, but the idea will be transferred over to other fields like <br> full-time workers with minor adjustments. 
														The idea really centers on college life and a student’s hectic <br>schedule and how to best manage their time.  
														The motivation is an obvious one so we decided this would be a more <br> beneficial and useful application than those that have been thought of in the past. 
														When it comes to more specific <br> functionalities we would like to touch on the prioritizing notifications concept, which will be the most useful and <br> difficult to design. 
														The idea circles around setting up a system that can organize your coursework based on a <br> busy schedule. 
														After entering your week of activities into a simple calendar with the option to have classes and work <br> reoccurring the user will begin submitting assignments and one-time events to the program. 
														These events will be <br> prioritized based on a simple algorithm comparing the users set priority, completion time estimation, and due date. <br>
														This application is meant to take a simple calendar with reminders to the next level of organization. </p>
